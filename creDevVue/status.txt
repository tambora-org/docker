Todo:
=====

Add polyfills for compatibility reasons
https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs
 <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/webcomponentsjs/1.2.0/webcomponents-loader.js"></script>
   

Version init with CRE_VERSION not working?
Use v instead.

Pipeline with webpack
web components
vue

https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/docs/components/tabs/   #bootstrap components
use or adapt react-native components for web as well?
i.e. tabs:  https://github.com/spatie/vue-tabs-component  -> see implementation may use mechanism for webgeo-pages inside webgeo-module
Which tabs to use? react-native, bootstrap, spatie, ... ???

eventBus seems to work somehow.
vuex works
Inject & Provide seems to fail.

Add npm-component directory (o.a) for compiled directories - add to npm
 * add script build-sync, build-async, build-single
  * change name to directory/filename -> kebab
  * npm-get-version & patch ?
