Still in prototype status

Todo:
=====
* Access rights GRANT for user not enough (i.e. Schema) - i.e. tambora
* dump directory?
* Daily dump - Permission of directory cre/postgres/dump/db/....
* Check init db
* Citus
* POSTGRES_EXT allows to access DB for user globally by proxy/url (todo: specify list of dbs)
